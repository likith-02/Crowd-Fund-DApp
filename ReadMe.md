# Crowd Fund DApp

A single page web App based on ethereum blockchain built using Web3, Solidity and Reactjs.

This app is a mockup of Kickstarter which can reduce frauds with the help of blockchain and smart contracts by making transaction histories more transparent.

This app allows users to launch campaigns to raise funds and the usage requests of funds are approved by contributors(Donaters) based on weighted voting system.

Transactions related to campaign and the voting mechanism is entirely managed by the smart contract.
